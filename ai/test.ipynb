There are absolutely no signs of wear on the item or its packaging. Instructions are included. Item is suitable for presenting as a gift.There were no instructions and no box. The phone had been put in bubblewrap and shoved in a postage box with the accessories. Additionally, the \"free accessories\" that were provided had seen better days. The otterbox case was supposed to be white but it was so dirty and scratched it couldn't have been used.Now this may seem like I'm nit-picking but I really am not. I expected a like new phone and didn't get one. When you fork out $349 and it doesn't meet your expectations, it's very disappointing. Not to mention the fact it's a lot of money.Overall the seller was understanding, although he stood by his description and said the condition is subjective and down to the end users interpretation.

With shrink wrap and a sticker price that said new. He says no. This phone was manufactured in 2011. It's 2014 now so I say no.

We made the mistake of buying a used iPhone 4S without doing that and after we received it from an Amazon vendor, we found that it could not be activated because it was previously listed as lost or stolen. To Amazon's credit they refunded our money through their A to Z Guarantee. But don't put yourself in that position, check the serial number with your carrier BEFORE you buy!   \n",

I figured well maybe its just me, either way took it to Verizon and they had a problem programming the phone..well, I decided to get all the guess work out. The phone was NOT NEW, but USED and it was NOT a Verizon Phone.Sent it back via Amazon. Love Amazon...they know what to do...I mean the phone was over 600.00 dollars why would anyone think people would not notice these things.They took it back, even apologized, well of course...Don't cheat honest people, not all of us are unaware of what we get!   \n",
       "14097             The seller did a really good job on shipping quickly. I received the phone before the estimated due date which was great. What wasn't so great was the condition of the phone. It wasn't like new at all. The bottom part where the charging port is was all dented. There were also markings on the top part of the phone where the power button is situated. Amazon's description of Used - Like New: An apparently untouched item in perfect condition. Original protective wrapping may be missing, but the original packaging is intact and pristine. There are absolutely no signs of wear on the item or its packaging. Instructions are included. Item is suitable for presenting as a gift.There were no instructions and no box. The phone had been put in bubblewrap and shoved in a postage box with the accessories. Additionally, the \"free accessories\" that were provided had seen better days. The otterbox case was supposed to be white but it was so dirty and scratched it couldn't have been used.Now this may seem like I'm nit-picking but I really am not. I expected a like new phone and didn't get one. When you fork out $349 and it doesn't meet your expectations, it's very disappointing. Not to mention the fact it's a lot of money.Overall the seller was understanding, although he stood by his description and said the condition is subjective and down to the end users interpretation. Misleading in my book. So the phone was returned and I did get a full refund - thankfully.   \n",
       "14148  Not what you pay for. When I ordered this phone it was listed as new. I picked this one even though it was more expensive because it was listed as new. Within a few weeks of getting this phone I had some issues that were minor. When I would swipe down the at a glance view wouldn't pull down. I couldn't close some of my apps because the close button was high I the top right corner. A few weeks later I was notified that my email accounts were trying to be accessed from weird places and my Facebook account had been accessed from another country. And at about 2 months the phone just shut off and wouldn't turn on. I made an appt at Apple and drove the 1.5 hours to have them look at my new phone. After the tech tries to reload the software and there are still bugs. I tell him I don't understand I bought the phone 2 months ago. He askes from a friend. I say no new in box. With shrink wrap and a sticker price that said new. He says no. This phone was manufactured in 2011. It's 2014 now so I say no. He sends my phone to the back and they tell me the serial # on the box, the inside casing and one displayed in settings are all different. The screen isn't working correctly because it wasn't an apple screen and they can't work on the phone at all. I get amazon to take it back and see if they can send me a verified new one. They can't. So imagine my surprise when they charge me $65 to restock a used phone because they didn't send me what I paid for in the first place.   \n",

However, upon trying to activate the phone, I'm told this device can't be used on the Verizon network because it has been flashed. So, it seems that I've wasted about $230.00 dollars on a phone I can't use. I'd return it if I could but I understand that I've bought a \"pig-in-a-poke.\" I wouldn't recommend this seller or this phone. If I could get my money back, I'd use it to buy a phone from Verizon.   \n",

You wouldn't believe the messed up things this iphone does, no family or friends who all have iphones can believe how terribly this works (or I should say, doesn't work!). So after suffering all this time, my husband couldn't stand to hear me say one more time what a piece of junk I got, and he bought me a REALLY new iPhone through Verizon. I wouldn't take ANY chances with this \"company\". It was completely false advertising, there's no WAY this was new! I did have suspicions from the start, but nothing truly blatant so I could tell it had been used before. They'd cleaned it up pretty well. I think they should refund my money, but what are the chances of that happening??????   \n",

I ordered the iPhone 4s from Green Apple Classics and couldn't be happier!!!!! I had done a lot of research beforehand so I knew what to ask. GAC answered my question clearly and quickly. In fact the phone arrived earlier than the expected delivery date. It looked brand new and I love that it's one less cell phone in a landfill!! It did take about 2 hours on the phone with Trac phone to get the iPhone on our account but so far it works exactly as I wanted and my daughter loves it. I will look to GAC for future Apple purchases for sure!!!   \n",

It was delivered within 2 days which made me extremely happy as well. However when I opened the box I found a white iPhone. Not a big deal. I switched the phone over with ease and everything was perfect. Until I realized it wasnt a 4s either. I already had a white iPhone 4, why would I want another one??? I am so dissapointed. I called amazon and they recommended I just get a refund. Now I have to send back the phone I was so excited to get, and order another phone, probably from ebay. Cool. This will be the last time I order from Amazon for a while.   \n",

However, if the cost is too high, then i will opt for purchasing a new phone and discarding this :(   \n",

Scratches on the case and the hotspot and bluetooth features don't work. Battery life also seems a bit on the short side. These challenges probably go with buying a three year old design from an aftermarket dealer. On the plus side, the 4S has a much, much, much, better phone capability than the iPhone 5 series. On my iPhone 5 (dead from a dunking) I was lucky when I could carry on a conversation in our house or inside a building. Not so with the 4S, which is always rock solid. An Apple Tech explained that from the 5 series on, Apple switched to a smaller and less capable antenna to save space and money. Bad choice Apple, very bad.   \n",

(Only said good in advertisement)There are two things that I found, later on, that made the phone not so great.The bottom left speaker doesn't work. It sounded like the sound was low, but I just figured I was too used to the android I was using before. So that sucks, but not the worst thing in the world.The flashlight/camera flash doesn't work. I never really use either, but I noticed when I tried to take a picture if my sleeping baby one night. Again, not a big deal.So overall, I love this phone. But there were those two things that compelled me to give four, instead of five, stars.   \n",

It was delivered within 2 days which made me extremely happy as well. However when I opened the box I found a white iPhone. Not a big deal. I switched the phone over with ease and everything was perfect. Until I realized it wasnt a 4s either. I already had a white iPhone 4, why would I want another one??? I am so dissapointed. I called amazon and they recommended I just get a refund. Now I have to send back the phone I was so excited to get, and order another phone, probably from ebay. Cool. This will be the last time I order from Amazon for a while.   \n",

Contacted the seller. They e-mailed me to inform me I had sent the wrong order number. I responded with the correct order number and never heard back. I tried e-mailing two more times to no avail. While this was going on, the phone died and will not charge. I used this phone for less than 4 months. It is a total piece of junk. Buyer beware.   \n",

I just wish the Bluetooth worked!!! :-(Update: The battery no longer works and hasn't in months so I this was a waste of money. I guess I should have been more concerned with the limited battery life when I first got the phone and returned it then. Oh well it is an expensive lesson learned.   \n",

At first the voice activation would just activate itself when no one was touching it. Then it got a little more ballsy and started randomly dialing people in my contacts as if I had said \"Call the person in my phone book whom I have never called and would never call, Siri.\" After getting out of the shower one day I noticed the phone had me 5 mins into a \"butt dial\" voice mail w that very person in my contacts. Last straw. Returned.   \n",

Two days after the deadline the phone completely died. Took it to the local Apple store and their diagnosis showed that the phone had been malfunctioning, at the hard drive level, off and on almost since the day we had it activated. Explained the situation to CellularStream, who continue to insist their is nothing they can do. Would not recommend buying anything from CellularStream.   \n",

However it was not. I took it to the Apple store and they said it had a previous owner with over 600 charging cycles on the battery. So it was not new. The phone was in good condition so I kept it. However there were other iPhones that were listed as used that were cheaper. So because of the misrepresentation I payed more thinking I was getting new when it was used. So far the phone is working fine.   \n",

I have to turn the volume/ringer off when going to sleep so it will not wake me up. I think this phone was refurnished and it was fine for couple of months then the old problem for which it was refurbished came back. Unfortunately it is way past the returning period and I spent over $300.00 for this junk.   \n",

The bottom screws came right out. They're supposed to be epoxied into place and inside one of the screws holding the ribbon cable in place for the battery was just floating around. This was more like a bad refurbish job. Worked for two years which was good. Two stars though for the price. For over $300 it should have worked for three or more.   \n",

I was sold what was advertised as a Verizon network phone, paid for it (250 ish) waited more than a month for it, it is an apple 4s, it is not a Verizon network phone, and Verizon cannot activate it. The transaction was a fraud and I was left with a useless, paid for phone.   \n",

However, I had trouble getting service accepted on Tracfone because of the IMEI. Finally I talked with someone who accepted the receipt from the vendor working through Amazon.com and got the service.

The only other issue I have is the volume changing and some of the speaker areas are very dirty but I feel like that is expected for a used phone. All in all I love my iPhone.   \n",

Luckily I called Verizon and due to the fact that the no longer had any replacement iPhone 4S phone I was sent an iPhone 5 instead so in the end it was all worth it.   \n",

The phone even says its carrier is verizon. But verizon says the IMEI number can not be found in their network and they have failed to add it. Also, phone appears to be in decent except the front speaker which is filled with \"ear\" crud. Gross!!   \n",
